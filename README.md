# Theorizer: Analyze piano scores with a neural network that improves with use.

This project is 'in the works'. The plan is to put my NN from first_neural_networks onto a django backedn and create a API for it.


Api Endpoints:
GET /api/queries
GET /api/queries/#id
POST /api/query
PATCH /api/query/#id
DELETE /api/query/#id

What ones will I actually use? POST Query to the data base and the return the query. That's what I want, and

If I retrain the neural network, should I update the queries database? Yes, but how?
