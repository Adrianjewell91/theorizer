# Theorizer: Analyze piano scores with neural network.

http://theorizer.herokuapp.com

### Theorizer helps students analyze musical scores.

Theorizer is a tool for musical education. A neural network accepts input from either a keyboard or piano and returns musical information, such as chord name (C, D, E) and type (major, minor, diminished).

Production is currently in beta, and only supports major chords. Back-end is a Django framework with a Neural Network powered by Theano, Keras, and associated libraries. Front-end is a React.js/Redux single page application.

### Code Samples:

See Neural network here:

## Further Implementations:

1. Add Musical Score annotation feature.

2. Optimize neural-network/Django interactions.

3. Implement live-learning mechanism for neural network.
